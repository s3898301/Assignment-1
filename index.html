    <p>This project will be a network simulator tutorial which is aimed to help residents set up their network at home optimally to ensure coverage and understanding of devices like routers. </p>
  <p>This idea is interesting as from experience, I have had to gather information all by myself on the web to ensure that my wifi was working to the best. I want to ensure that people will be educated and know what will truly help their home networks.</p>
  <p>The product will be an interactive object oriented environment where users can select and connect devices, there will be descriptions and error checks which will help users build their own network and see the outcome. Indicators such as speed may be included to represent interaction and connection of devices.</p>
  <p>This software will only require a computer and program like visual studio to develop the app. This team will require programming and art. If this project is successful, users will be able choose what products to buy and what to use but also set up their home network by themselves.</p>

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-16" id="about">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">About me</h3>
    <p>My name is Minh Quang Pham, I was born in Australia on the 27th of December in 2002, my background and second language is Vietnamese. I attended Braybrook College as my secondary school from year 7-12. My hobbies are playing games, cooking and looking up the web. I prefer a strong competition if I’m up against my friends and have a natural curiosity for things, to the extent that I would research anything for fun. I am usually open and happy to meet new people as long as they’re happy to do the same, but I always prefer to have a laugh with the funniest people.

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-16" id="about">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Interest in IT</h3>
    <p>From a young age, I was fascinated with the devices I had at home. I took an interest in IT since I like working with computers and making interactions that look miraculous. At home I am the only one who is the most familiar with technology and therefore it is my responsibility to deal with any management and improvement of our daily tasks.

Since I’m the self-appointed IT technician at home, it has paved way to my further curiosity of technology and motivation for problem solving. Bad Wifi and latency had led me to learning about the router and how to maximise the usage and effect of my router. I made a minecraft server for friends which also led me to learning about ip addresses and connections. Programming at school inspired me to learn to command, even though it was small such as making a cookie clicker game out of text boxes and buttons that gave me a sense of achievement and something to be proud of. Building computers is another milestone that I’ve accomplished as I’ve also learnt about hardware and how computers work. All these experiences that I’ve accumulated keeps me moving forward and learning more as one day I want to become a professional IT genius.

I chose to study at RMIT since it was the perfect choice for me out of many aspects, convenience, interest and reputation for technology.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Ideal Job</h3>
    <p>I plan on working in the cybersecurity field, working as a penetration tester cooperating with a client company. My end goal is to become a cyber security architect, it is a senior-level leadership role that specializes in planning, designing, testing, implementing and maintenance for security systems. 

The bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the growth rate for cyber security jobs is estimated to be 37% between 2012-2022. This is an opportunity since job prospects will be higher as technology will further advance and therefore security will need to become tighter. The pay is also ideal with a median salary of $160,796.

I chose to aim for this role in particular as it is a chance for me to innovate and become creative with designs. It also serves as a milestone to my skill set and threshold into making change for the cyber security field.

The pathway to this job requires experience and qualifications, which is why finding an internship or at least an entry level job such as an administrator or analyst is necessary. Also completing appropriate certificates of the following: CEH, CISSP, CISSP-ISSAP, CISM, CSSA, GSEC / GCIH / GCIA.

Promoting to architect requires at least 5-10 years worth of experience, it also requires hard skills such as understanding of operating systems, aspects of wireless security, knowledge of security concepts, etc.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Personality</h3>
    <p>As a virtuoso, I prefer work that is interactive and practical which matches well with being a visual learner. Based on my visual summary of my personality test, I am most likely to prefer solo work but can be flexible but I am prone to being disorganised. The method which I may conduct leans towards traditional outlooks and technical problem solving.

These results may mean that when working in teams, the tasks delegated should be unique and separate to prevent disturbance of the team’s work environment. A solid plan structure should be established to prevent confusion and ensure work stays consistent and understandable for me and the team.
